<b>Alpha 4.01 Changelog</b>

GM Land was designed to entertain multiple level 1 players in a PvP scenario. Currently we are a bit short on players, but those who do play should be able to have some fun too!

I've added a "Turf Monsta" monster character to the map. This monsta drops an extremely epic weapon! If you find yourself vsing the godbow and want to try it just PM IKuPAI in discord and I'll get you one for testing!
